# Privacy Policy

The app "Youtube Playlist Viewer" requests a temporary access token from google which allows reading private information from your youtube account.

The app will use the token to get information about your created playlists and the videos inside of them, so that it can display them on the page.

The token and any information fetched using that token is stored locally within the browser and is cleared whenever the browser is closed.
