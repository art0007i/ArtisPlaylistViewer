      <h1>Privacy Policy - Arti's Playlist Viewer</h1>

      <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
      <p>
        Arti's Playlist Viewer requests a temporary access token from Google through the Google OAuth API.
        This token allows us to access the following Google user data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The list of playlists you have created on your YouTube account</li>
        <li>The titles, video IDs, and metadata of videos contained in your playlists</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Google User Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use the data accessed from your YouTube account solely to display your playlists and the videos within them
        in the Arti's Playlist Viewer interface.
      </p>
    
      <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, transfer, or disclose your Google user data to any third parties
        under any circumstances.
      </p>
    
      <h2>4. Data Protection Measures</h2>
      <p>
        All data accessed via the Google API is stored locally in your browser's memory. We do <strong>not</strong> send or store any user data on our servers or third-party services. This local storage is automatically cleared when the browser session ends or the tab is closed. Your data never leaves your device.
      </p>
    
      <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> retain any of your Google user data. Once your session ends (i.e., you close the browser or tab), all data — including the Google access token and playlist information — is permanently deleted from your browser memory.
      </p>
